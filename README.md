### Hello, I am Tejaswini Kesi Reddy. 

I am a **Computer Science** Sophomore at *Missouri State University*, 
passionate about learning to develop software applications.  

I work with python and a bit of c++. 
Comparitively, I like playing with python better.
I am currently learning about data structures and github. 

### Projects I've worked on:
- **Time Converter (C++)**
    - Developed a C++ application that can take 
      a 12-hour time format and convert it to 24-hour time 
      format and vise-versa.
- **Retail Price Calculator (C++)** 
    - Created a C++ application that can get the wholesale cost
      and markup percentage of a product to calculate the retail price.
- **Ping Pong Game (Python)**
    - Developed a python application that can allow users to play 
      ping pong game with modifying bail colors along with 
      memory allocation for scores and results. 
      
### My hobbies:
- 🏸 Badminton
- 🎙️ Singing
- 📔 Journaling
- 🎨 Art
- 💃 Making tiktok dances

I don't really have a favorite hobby, but I loose track of time 
when I work on my art pieces.
