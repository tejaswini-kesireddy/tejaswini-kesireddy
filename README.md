### Hello, I am Tejaswini Kesi Reddy. 

I am a software developer based in the US. 
I am currently pursuing my Bachelor's in Computer Science at Missouri State University. 
My major interest is on web development and programming languages. 
I like creating APIs with high level programming languages to solve real world problems.


### Projects I've worked on:
- **WeatherTogether (Python)**
    - Developed a crowd casting application, that notifies
      subscribed users when there are severe weather alerts.
      This application can gather data from users about
      weather conditions and cast them to all subscribers.
- **Portfolio (HTML, CSS)**
    - Hosted a static website on AWS S3,
      with CloudFront as CDN and wrap SSL certificate.
      The website uses API Gateway and Serverless function (AWS lambda)
      for contact form submission.
